## Project Description

This project, it's part of my final Bachelors Degree Thesis for Universitat Politécnica de Catalunya. 

The project contains a real-time application developed with **Unreal Engine 5.0.2** that shows an architectural visualization testing Lumen, Nanite and Virtual Shadow Mapping technology. Moreover, each asset seen in this project have been modeled and textured by me*.

*Only exception for vegetation using Quixel Megascans libraries.

## Application Controls

**Key 1:** Change between static camera viewpoints.
> Camera viewpoints can be changed with **Left/Right arrows**
 
**Key 2:** Enable player controller and navigate through the scene.
> **WASD + Mouse :** Move camera around scene in this mode

**Key 3**: Start camera sequences.

**Escape:** Show Settings menu.
>In settings menu the user can cap framerate(by default uncaped at -1), change between different screen resolutions, enable/disable Vsync, change scalability settings related with quality settings and exit the application.

**L:** Turn *on/off* artificial lighting.

**Q/E:** Camera Up/Down.

### Debug Modes

**F1:** Show GPU status.

**F2:** Show current framerate.

## ChangeLog

**-version 0.1**
- Basic Illumination and Postprocess implemented
- Blockout with some finished assets placed in scene
- Prototype functional( static cameras, free camera, sequences...)

**-version 0.2**

- Polished illumination using blue lighting mixed with artificial calid lighting
- Added static viewpoints to the camera array.
- Placed finished assets in some areas.
- Escape to exit application function added.
- Enable/Disable lights functional.

**-version 0.3**

- Implemented scalability settings to avoid performance issues and adapt to different devices.
- Quit button instead escape.
- Key bindings to display performance indicators( current framerate, gpu status...).

**-version 0.3.1**

- Improved and optimized UI for scalability settings.

**-version 0.4**

- Scene polish, more finished assets added.
- Implemented buttons to change between two resolutions *(1920x1080 and 1280x720)*.
- FPS cap option now functional in settings menu.
- Fixed screen resolution by default to 1280x720px
- Enabled RTX hardware raytracing + lumen technology.

**-version 0.5**

- Disabled RTX hardware raytracing options due to performance and testing issues.
- Troubleshooting non-working VSync option.
- Multiple resolutions added using ComboBox instead of resolution buttons as in 0.4.

**-version 0.6**

- VSync enabled by default.
- Setting up final static camera viewpoints + postprocessing.
- Changed game settings to enable by default windowed mode.

**-version 1.0**

- Placed final assets.
- Static cameras adjustments, reducing post-process values as bloom fx.
- Final camera sequences and adjustments.
- Asset auditation and general memory reducement.
